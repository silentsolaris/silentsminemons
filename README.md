**Silent's Minemons!**
----------------------------------
This pack aims to add fakemon inspired by VANILLA minecraft mobs, while not being too blunt!
The goal is to make fakemon that aren't just a 1-to-1 mob but pokefied, 
but something I think could actually fit with the existing dex of mons!

WARNING : PUT THE PACK IN YOUR RESOURCEPACK FOLDER, AND THE DATAPACK FOLDER OF YOUR SAVE.
This datapack requires Cobblemon to work (obviously)
